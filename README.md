# MyHomeworkApp

MyHomeworkApp is a webapp concept in which the UI and UX was designed in Figma, Adobe XD and Photoshop. This app aims to help students keep track of their homework and grades for each course and better their studying habits. I haven't able to find any homework trackers that also keep track of grades and I wanted to get some practice with figma (yes, I'm late to the game :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:).

I really wanted to focus on human centered design that was intuitive enough to use without any in-app tutorials (lol). Inspired from some of the amazing user experiences over at [Notion](https://notion.so) and my struggles as a student, I was set on building something that actually helped students achieve their academic goals.
